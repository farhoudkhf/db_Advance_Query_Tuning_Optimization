 # 📊 Database Project Portfolio – Certification Design

## Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end design and deployment of a relational database system to manage organizational certifications and skills. It covers schema definition, data loading and transformation, trigger automation, and reporting using advanced SQL queries.

---

## 📁 Project Structure


---

## 🛠 Features

### 1. Schema Design & Blueprint
- Logical table structures with appropriate keys and relationships
- ERD created to visualize and validate data model
- All constraints managed via SQL scripts

### 2. Automated Data Loading
- VBA scripts used to generate dynamic SQL `INSERT` statements
- Supports scalable and repeatable data load process

### 3. Data Transformation
- Data cleaned and standardized before/after loading
- Scripts include:
  - Whitespace trimming
  - Duplicate removal

### 4. Trigger Logic
- SQL triggers created to automate and validate data entry
- Ensures consistency and enforces business logic at the DB level

### 5. Reporting & Query Templates
- SQL scripts for extracting key insights:
  - Skills by organization
  - Certification statistics
  - Date-range-based reports
- CSV export sample provided for integration or sharing

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **SQL** – pgadmin, vscode, Views, Triggers, Constraints
- **VBA** – Script automation for SQL generation
- **PostgreSQL** (or compatible RDBMS)
- **ERD Tools** – Diagramming and design validation
- **Markdown & PDF** – Documentation and deployment notes

---

## 📈 Sample Output

A sample exported view:  
**`view_course_skills_orgs.csv`**

This file demonstrates joined data between courses, skills, and organizations, as generated by `views_skills_org.sql`.

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Execute `buildScript_b104_[FK_constraints].sql` to create schema and relations.
3. Use `insertOrgs_Scripts.txt` and `insertSkill_lines_scripts.txt` to populate base tables.
4. Run transformation script `trim_remove_duplicate.sql`.
5. Apply triggers using `trigger_data_entry.sql`.
6. Use the queries in the `reports/` folder to generate insights.
